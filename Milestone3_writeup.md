## Usefulness of Feedback

- **Usability of your app**: It was easy for the peers to use the app, there were few filters which we did expected they would try but during the fly-on-wall activity, they worked around the app very differently. Overall they were able to use the app easily.

- **Similar comments across reviewers**: There were some similar reviews about the reactivity and the x-axis of the plots. 

- **Things we changed in the app**: We fixed the reactivity of the drop-down menu and the slider after peers found an issue where the plots were not updating immediately.

- **Unreasonable to change**: One of the feedbacks was to add tab in the app for data. This change we have not yet worked on. We do not think it would be not be that useful. 

- **Least valuable feedback**: The least valuable feedback we got was on the color choices of our plots.Color choices are partially subjective. Also, the peer did not explain why they did not like the colors. That made it harder to figure out what better colors we could try.

- **Most valuable feedback and improved app**: We received a lot of useful feedback from our peers.  Since most of the feedback was very useful, we made several improvements to the app to address the issues brought up.
Other pieces of feedbackled to us making improvements that were simple to implement but still made the app more effective.Several users suggested adding a description to explain what kind of usage scenario the app is intended to address.
This was easy to implement, and the usage tab makes it easier for the user to use the app.

- **Fly-on-the-wall session**: One lesson we learned from the fly-on-the-wall session was that what we found obvious wasn't obvious to the users.
For instance, we know what each graph is showing without having to look at the graph titles. However, some users were confused about the content of the different graphs.

## How the App has Changed since Milestone 2

**Implementation**

For Milestone 2, we had decided to replace the graph of the top ten cities with graphs of the four types of crime when a user selected different types of crimes.
For Milestone 3, we changed the app to show the top ten cities and the bottom ten cities on static graphs.
The graphs for the four types of crime still update with the user selections.  

**Design change**

We made this design change to help the user make comparisons between cities.  
By always having the top and bottom ten cities visible, the user can see if the cities they selected are closer to the bottom ten or top ten cities.
